Compare raw JSON lists from IG to textdiff for unmatching followers/following accounts.

# Instagram Follower Diff Tool

🧭 A lightweight, local script to compare your Instagram **followers** and **following** lists using the official data export. Helps identify:

- Accounts that don’t follow you back (`following - followers`)
- Accounts that follow you but you don’t follow (`followers - following`)

⚠️ This tool does **not** scrape or use the Instagram API, and respects platform limitations. It’s safe for personal use and requires zero login or automation.
